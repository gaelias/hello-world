Turorial byproduct

Hello, I've seen github linked a bunch and figured I should jump on the bandwagon! I'm a neuroscientist by training with no formal coding training. I have been using MATLAB for ~9yrs now to do data collection and analysis and am pretty comfortable navigating my way through it at this point. This is me expanding my horizons so to speak.
